# Live Face Recognition

Using Python and OpenCV this project learns the facial feature and recognizes the person. After training, it can recognise the person in a live video footage along with providing the confidence as well. This project uses haar cascade to identify human faces.

To successfully run this program, make sure you have the latest version of OpenCV installed. Follow the steps below:

1) In the "train" folder make a new folder Providing the name of the person whose face is to be trained.
2) Add as many photo as you can. The more the data, the more efficient is the training. Name the folder with the person's name. 
3) Open the "face_train.py" in a suitable code editor and add the name of the person(in the same manner as it is named in the folder name) in the "people" array.
4) Run the "face_train.py" code.
5) Run the "face_recognition.py" code to check the result.
